# Analysis of Matches_Football_European

## Description
The overarching goal of this project is to delve deep into the world of soccer by analyzing an extensive dataset that includes leagues, teams, players, and match outcomes. The project aims to answer a set of key questions that explore the intricacies of soccer matches, player performance, and the betting landscape. Predictive models are developed to forecast match outcomes and player performances.

## Purpose
This project leverages a rich dataset containing detailed information about soccer matches, players, teams, and leagues to answer critical questions and build predictive models. Data includes match outcomes, player attributes, team attributes, and betting odds from various bookmakers.

### Tools & Technologies
- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and statsmodels for data manipulation and modeling
- Data visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn

## Data Overview
The dataset used in this project is derived from the sqlite_sequence table, which is a special table maintained by SQLite.

## Results & Conclusions
### Leagues and Countries
Mapped European football leagues to their respective countries, providing a foundational understanding of the landscape.

### Goal Scoring Trends
Identified leagues with the highest and lowest average goals per match.

### Home Advantage
Confirmed the existence of a "home advantage" in varying degrees across different leagues.

### Predicting Match Outcomes
Built a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of a home team win based on team attributes. The model achieved an accuracy of around 95% on the test set.

### Player Attributes vs. Team Success
Attempted to correlate player attributes, such as speed and agility, with team success metrics.

### League Competitiveness
Calculated the average goal difference in each league to gauge competitiveness.

### Overall Conclusion
The project provided insights into various facets of European football. While the models and analyses performed well, they also highlighted opportunities for further research and refinement.
